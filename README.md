### Application Breakdown
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- API calls to AlphaVantage
   * The resultant json contains 10+ years of data
   * While loop to retrieve year of study (2020)
 
- We use Pandas to:
   *  Retrieve and save the data from json format
   *  Drop rows with no values (no stocks operations) and keep available data
   *  Describe our data
   *  Estimate stocks performance (changes in prices at the begging and end of the year)
   
- We use Matplotlib to analyze sector and companies stock prices performance during 2020. 
  *  Bar and line charts
