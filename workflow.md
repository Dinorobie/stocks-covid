## **API tests**

- Quandl
    - After doing some test-calls to quandl API we found out that most of the data dates back 2 years, which falls out of our defined timeline (08/01/2019-07/31/2020)
- Alphavantage
    - After a quick test on Alphavantage API it appears that stock prices data is updated on a daily basis
    - Their API calls are not as robust as Quandl and will need to make a series of calls to obtain relevant data

## **Industries to track**
- Pharmaceutical (XPH)
